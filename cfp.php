<h1>Call for Participation</h1>

<p>
O'Reilly & Associates is pleased to announce the 1st annual PHP
Conference. This event is the central gathering place for the PHP
community to exchange ideas, techniques, and to advance the language. The
PHP Conference is a five-day event designed for PHP programmers and
developers and technical staff involved in PHP technology and its
applications. The conference will be part of the O'Reilly Open Source
Convention alongside the 5th annual Perl Conference at the Sheraton San
Diego Hotel and Marina, San Diego, California, July 23-27, 2001.
</p>

<p>
The Open Source Conference includes two days of intensely focused
tutorials aimed mainly at intermediate and advanced PHP, Perl and Python
programmers along with users of popular technologies such as XML, MySQL,
Mozilla, Apache, Tcl and Zope.  These tutorials are designed to provide 
concrete knowledge that leads directly to better programs.  Three days 
of multi-tracked conference sessions focus on the cutting edge technology 
and feature talks, demonstrations, and panel debates on topics ranging from
object-orientation to data mining.
</p>
<p>
Technically sophisticated individuals who are actively working with the
technology make all tutorial and conference presentations. Presentations
by marketing staff or with a marketing focus will not be accepted.
