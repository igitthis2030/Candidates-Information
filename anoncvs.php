<h3>What is CVS?</h3>
<p>
 You can find more information about CVS, and
 download clients for most major platforms, at
 <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/">the CVS Wiki</a>.
</p>

<h3>CVS mirroring</h3>
<p>
 You can also mirror the PHP CVS repository using CVSup, see
 <a href="/cvsup.php">our CVSup page</a> for more details.
</p>

<h3>Contribute</h3>
<p>
 If you would like to join PHP development or would like to
 contribute to the PHP documentation, contact the relevant
 group. You will need <a href="/cvs-php.php">your own CVS account</a>
 to contribute.
</p>

<h3>Source and binary snapshots</h3>
<p>
 You may also be interested in a PHP snapshot, see
 <a href="http://snaps.php.net/">snaps.php.net</a>.
 Compiled snapshots for Windows users are also included.

<h1>Anonymous CVS Access</h1>

<p>
 If you wish to get the latest PHP source tree, you can obtain it
 through anonymous CVS. You should be warned that the CVS version
 is a development version, and as such, is often unstable, and may
 not even compile properly. The advantage of using CVS, though,
 is that you can get the latest fixes and updates, without having
 to wait for the official releases.
</p>

<p>
 PHP uses an advanced configuration system that requires you to have
 the following tools. Re2c is only necessary for developers and can be found 
 <a href="http://re2c.org">here</a>.
 All other utilities can be obtained from
 <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">the GNU FTP site</a>.
</p>

<ul>
 <li><i>autoconf</i>: 2.13</li>
 <li><i>automake</i>: 1.4+</li>
 <li><i>libtool</i>: 1.4.x+ (except 1.4.2)</li>
 <li><i>bison</i>: 1.28, 1.35, 1.75, 2.0 or higher</li>
 <li><i>flex</i>: 2.5.4 (<strong>not higher</strong>)</li>
 <li><i>re2c</i>: 0.9.11+ (0.12.0+ for HEAD)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps for using PHP from CVS</h2>
<ol>
 <li>
  It is recommended that you configure CVS by putting this
  in your <code>~/.cvsrc</code> file:
<pre>
cvs -z3
update -d -P
checkout -P
diff -u
</pre>
 </li>

 <li>
  Log in to the PHP CVS server. We'll use the anonymous user <strong>cvsread</strong> 
  as the username, and use <strong>phpfi</strong> as the password:<br />
  <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login</code>
 </li>
 
 <li>
  Obtain the latest PHP source from CVS. There is a single <i>php-src</i> 
  directory that contains all PHP branches. To get PHP from CVS, 
  use the <i>"cvs checkout -r BRANCH"</i> notation. To checkout the
  latest, consider the following CVS commands:<br /><br />
  <strong>PHP 4.4</strong>: 
  <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -r PHP_4_4 php-src</code>
  <br />
  <strong>PHP 5.2</strong>:
  <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -r PHP_5_2 php5</code>
  <br />
  <strong>PHP 5.3</strong>:
  <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -r PHP_5_3 php5</code>
  <br />
  <strong>PHP 6</strong>: 
  <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout php6</code>
  <br /><br />
  Some tips and notes:
  <br />
  <div class="tip">
   <p>You may retrieve a specific release of PHP from CVS by using the
   <i>-r</i> flag in your cvs command. Some examples:<br />
   <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -r php_4_2_1 php-src</code><br />
   <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -r php_4_3_2 php-src</code></p>
  </div>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The branch names can also be used for cvs diff and merge operations.
   </li>
   <li>
    You can also specify the directory name, for example, to put PHP 6 HEAD into a directory 
    named php6dev:<br />
    <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout -d php6dev php6</code>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 
 <li>
  Make sure you have autoconf 2.13 or newer, automake 1.4 or newer and libtool
  1.4.
  <div class="tip" style="margin: 10px 0 10px 20px;">
   <p>Note that certain combinations of autoconf, automake and libtool may not
   work when used together. See <a href="#buildconf_fail">below</a> for
   details.<br />
   Also, certain versions of autoconf may generate warnings of <code>AC_PROG_CPP
   called before AC_PROG_CC</code>. These messages can usually be ignored.</p>
  </div>
 </li>
  
 <li>
  Run <code>./buildconf</code>. After a while, the configure script should be generated.
 </li>
  
 <li>
  From this point onwards, installation is similar to the installation of one of
  the official packages with one main difference &ndash; you must have bison 1.28 or later
  and flex 2.5.4 to compile, because the pre-generated scanner and parser
  files are not included in CVS.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>
 There are also other things, like the XML source code
 for the documentation, available via anonymous CVS. See
 <a href="http://cvs.php.net/">the web-based view of the CVS
 server</a> to see what is available. For example, to checkout the
 latest english version of the PHP manual:<br />
 <code>cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout phpdoc</code>
</p>

<h2>autoconf, automake and libtool information</h2>

<p>
 There seem to be problems with libtool 1.4.2. It is suggested
 that you use libtool 1.4, along with autoconf 2.13 and
 automake 1.4. You should also ensure that autoconf, automake
 and libtool are installed in the same directory. libtool 1.5
 will not work.
</p>

<p>The following combinations are known to work:</p>
<ul>
 <li>autoconf 2.13, automake 1.4 and libtool 1.4.3</li>
 <li>autoconf 2.13, automake 1.5 and libtool 1.4.3</li>
</ul>

<a name="flex_fail"></a>
<h2>Zend/zend_language_scanner.c: No such file or directory</h2>

<p>
 PHP only supports flex 2.5.4, <strong>not</strong> later versions as they broke backwards compatibility
