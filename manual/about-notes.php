<P>The manual notes interface allows you to add notes to the online
version of the PHP manual. These notes are then shared with other
PHP users when they browse the manual online.

<P>Periodically, the developers may go through the notes and incorporate
the information in them into the documentation proper.

<P>These notes are only visible at <A href="http://www.php.net/manual/">www.php.net</A>
because that's where the database that stores them is located. We're
working on a way of supporting this across our many mirrors.

<P>These notes are <B>not</B> the place to report <A href="http://bugs.php.net">bugs</A>!
