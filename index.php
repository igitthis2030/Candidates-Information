<h1>
So, How Much Does It Cost?
</h1>
<p>
This may sound a little foreign to all you folks coming from a non-Unix
background, but PHP doesn't cost anything.  You can use it for commercial
and/or non-commercial use all you want.  You can give it to your friends,
print it out and hang it on your wall or eat it for lunch.  Welcome to
the world of <? print_link("http://www.opensource.org", "Open Source"); ?> software!  
Smile, be happy, the world is good.  For the full legalese, see the
