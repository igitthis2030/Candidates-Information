According to NetCraft surveys, PHP is now the most popular module for the 
Apache server and in total running on something like two million Web sites. 
Here are some of the reasons why PHP is such a popular server side scripting language.

?>
I first discovered PHP a little over a year ago at Freshmeat.net. Because most 
non-commercial sites at that time used Perl CGI scripts for dynamic content, 
I found it interesting that Freshmeat's dynamic pages all ended with .php3 
instead of the .pl or .cgi associated with Perl/CGI sites like Slashdot. I 
did a little exploring, quickly downloaded PHP version 3, and immediately 
became a PHP fan.

?>
The literal translation of LinuxTag is LinuxDay. This title is a leftover from ancient 
times, when the event really lasted one day. This year the event occupied the fair in 
Stuttgart for four whole days, beginning at thurday with a business congress. For 
those commercially relevant lectures you had to pay. However, a total of over 100 
hours of free lectures followed from friday to sunday, addressing the interests of 
end-users and developers. During all days companies and free software developers 
showed their Linux-products on an area of 6.000 m². An estimated number of 17,000 people 
visited the LinuxTag, making it a big success to be repeated next year.

MySQL and PHP have developed a special sort of relationship over the past few years, 
perhaps due in large part to the fact that they are both freely available for download. 
The increased popularity of this dynamic duo, coupled with boundless enthusiasm from core 
developers of both technologies, culminated in a "meeting of the minds" in Israel earlier 
this year. This resulted in the MySQL library being packaged with the PHP 4.0 distribution, 
in addition to an agreement to help each other improve the performance quality of product 
integration whenever the opportunity arises.

features, and provides today a base that can easily stand out in the
increasingly crowded server-side application development platform market.
