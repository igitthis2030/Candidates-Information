<h1>Documentation - Extended CHM Format</h1>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
 PHP usage increases from one month to the other, and this includes the
 expansion of PHP on Windows. Since many users would like to have an easily
 accessible and fast help resource to assist their daily work, we decided to
 create an extended CHM version of the manual, which includes many additional
 features, compared to the <a href="/download-docs.php">regular CHMs</a>.
</p>

<p>
 The development of this edition is still in progress, thus currently only
 an English version is available. Sometime we hope we can make all the
 languages available with the feature set provided in this extended CHM.
 The <a href="mailto:php-doc-chm@lists.php.net">php-doc-chm</a> dedicated
 mailing list exists for discussion related to this edition of the manual.
 You can find subscription options as well as the archives on our
 <a href="/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists page</a>.
</p>

<a name="knownbugs"></a>
<h2>Known bugs and limitations</h2>

<p>
 Though there are CHM viewers for non-Windows platforms, we use
 JScript objects in the CHM, so this edition will probably not work
 for those trying to view the contents in alternate viewers.
</p>

<a name="ides"></a>
<h2>IDE integration</h2>

<p>
 As the CHM versions of the PHP manual are used on more and more
 development machines, IDE authors also began to add support
 for the CHMs in their IDEs. Here are some IDEs that support the
 integration of this CHM at different levels. If you know of any
 more IDEs that should be listed here, please write to the
 <a href="#intro">mailing list mentioned above</a>. If you
 are an IDE author, and would like to get more technical info on
 HTML Help, read the integration section in the CHM.

 <li>
  <strong><a href="http://www.code-genie.com">Code-Genie</a>:</strong> Copy the
  help file to the helps subdirectory of Code-Genie. Alternatively,
  you can create a shortcut to the help file (a file with .lnk extension) and
  place this link file to the helps subdir of Code-Genie. The shortcut will
  be resolved at run time.

  <strong><a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com">CrimsonEditor</a>:</strong> The
  <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/english/docs/howtos.html#howto01">author
  of the editor describes</a> how to integrate HLP and CHM files with
  keyword indexes into the IDE. This method works quite well, with
  our CHMs.

 <li>
  <strong><a href="http://devphp.sf.net/">Dev-PHP 2</a>:</strong>
  Go to "Options" &raquo; "General options", and select the "Extra" tab in

  this tool, and so you can access the help anytime with that.

 <li>
  <strong><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/homesite/">HomeSite</a></strong>:
  Since .chm help files are basically executables in HomeSite, you 
  integrate Compiled HTML Help sets by adding them as a custom toolbar 
  button. Install the help set wherever you like, then created a 
  toolbar button set to "Launch an external application" with the 
  filename pointing to the main .chm file.

  assign a hotkey and/or a context menu option to it.
  <pre>CHM_location = "C:\\PHP\\php_manual_en.chm";

   (line breaks added for clarity - should be on a single line):
  </p>

   &lt;Command name="PHP Manual" Ctrl="yes" Alt="yes" Shift="no" Key="116"&gt;
   hh.exe "ms-its:c:/Program Files/Phpmanual/php_manual_en.chm::/function.$(CURRENT_WORD).html"
