       The PHP development team would like to announce the 8th
       <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
       PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy
       (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the
       <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong>
         THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!
       </strong>.
     </p>
     <p>
       This is the 8th release candidate. The release candidate phase is
       intended as a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new
       features should be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0.
     </p>
     <p>
       The 7th and 8th release candidates focus on fixing critical bugs and
       security vulnerabilities, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>
         A buffer overflow in htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities()
         (<a href="https://bugs.php.net/60965">bug #60965</a>).
       </li>
       <li>
         Improving the max_input_vars configuration directive to check nested
         variables.
       </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       A complete list of changes since the last release candidate can be
       found in the
       <a href="https://svn.php.net/repository/php/php-src/tags/php_5_4_0RC8/NEWS">NEWS</a>
       file.
     </p>
     <p>
       We've received a lot of feedback that has helped to improve the
       upcoming release of PHP 5.4.0. Please continue to help us to identify
       bugs in order to ensure that the release is solid and all things behave
       as expected by taking the time to test this release candidate against
       your code base and reporting any problems that you encounter to
       the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailing list</a> and/or
       the <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
       The next release candidate will be released on
       March 1.
