     The migration of the PHP source code from Subversion to Git is complete.
     You can clone or fork the source from our
     <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">GitHub mirror</a>, and we also
     now support pull requests made via GitHub. The source is also available
     via <a href="http://git.php.net/">git.php.net</a>, and full instructions
     on cloning the php-src tree can be found at
     <a href="http://php.net/git">php.net/git</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
     One immediate benefit is that future PHP release tags will be signed by
     the PHP development team. We will be releasing GPG keys for verification
     purposes in the next few days.
    </p>

    <p>
     More information on the migration and the new workflow can be found at the
     <a href="https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitfaq">Moving to Git FAQ</a> on the PHP
     Wiki.
    </p>

    <p>
     Please note that the PHP manual, including translations, continues to be
     hosted in Subversion for the time being and will be migrated to Git at a
     later date.
    </p>

    <p>
     Many thanks to David Soria Parra for his hard work on making the conversion
     to Git a reality, and to Alexander Moskaliov, Florian Anderiasch and
     Johannes Schl&#252;ter for their work on the scripts required to support
     the conversion. Let the forking begin!
