         <a href="http://soflophp.org/">SoFloPHP</a> is excited to present the inaugural <a href="http://sunshinephp.com/">SunshinePHP Developer Conference</a> in Miami, Florida
         from February 8th - 9th, 2013.  This 2 day event will feature 3 awesome tracks, with one track
         dedicated to Symfony.  We are also planning an Uncon, as well as a hack event, and many
         opportunities to socialize with the PHP community.  Please register soon to take advantage of
         our early bird discounted rate before it ends.
     </p>
     <p>
         In February when the rest of the world is cold and snowy, it is sunny and beautiful in
         Florida. Come join us for some sun and learning.
     </p>
     <p>
         Our call for papers runs until December 1st, 2012, so please get those talks in!  We will
         be announcing the sessions and speakers around mid-December after our board has a chance to
         consider each submission.
