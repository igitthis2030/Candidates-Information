         The PHP development team announces the 6th
         <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
         PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy
         (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the
         <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.

         <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>.

     <p>
         This is the 6th release candidate. The release candidate phase is intended as
         a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new features should
         be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0. </p>
     <p>
         The 6th release candidate focused on improving traits. Please test
         them carefully and help us to identify bugs in
         order to ensure that the release is solid and all things behave
         as expected. Please take the time to test this release candidate
         against your code base and report any problems that you encounter
         to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailing list</a> and/or
