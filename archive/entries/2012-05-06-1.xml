    <p>PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described
    in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use
    an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use <strong>$*</strong>
    instead of <strong>"$@"</strong> to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of
    issues. Again, people using mod_php or php-fpm are not affected.</p>

    <p>
    One way to address these CGI issues is to reject the request if the query string
    contains a '-' and no '='. It can be done using Apache's mod_rewrite like this:

    <pre>
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
    RewriteRule .? - [F,L]
    </pre>

    Note that this will block otherwise safe requests like ?top-40 so if you
    have query parameters that look like that, adjust your regex accordingly.</p>
    
    <p>Another set of releases are planned for Tuesday, May, 8th. These
    releases will fix the CGI flaw and another CGI-related issue in
    apache_request_header (5.4 only).</p>

    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience created with these releases and the
    (lack of) communication around them.</p>
